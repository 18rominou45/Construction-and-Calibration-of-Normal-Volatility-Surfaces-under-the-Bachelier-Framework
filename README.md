# Construction of Normal Volatility Surfaces under the Bachelier Framework

## Objective
This project implements a complete pipeline to construct normal (Bachelier) implied volatility surfaces from option prices, including pricing, inversion, calibration, interpolation, and visualization.

## Scope
- Bachelier pricing model
- Normal implied volatility
- Volatility smiles and surfaces
- Numerical calibration and interpolation

## Non-objectives
- Arbitrage-free guarantees
- Production-grade implementation
- Real-time market data

## Tools
Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
